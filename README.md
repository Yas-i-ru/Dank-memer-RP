# Dank memer RP
**Dank memer custom rich presence read this document carefully before use** 

Setting up,
1. Download the zip file unzip the content into one folder 
2. Edit the `data.ini` to your need
3. Run the `.exe`

The `.exe` would take some time to properly load up and all content inside the `.zip` needs to be in the same directory which the `.exe` is placed.  It would not function as intended if the `icon.ico` , `data.ini` files are missing.  Currently no known issues, How ever various errors might occur between devices. Make sure you submit a pull request if anything goes wrong.
